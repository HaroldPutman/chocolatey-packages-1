    <summary>The Minecraft Server Mod API Implementation</summary>
    <description>Our organization's aim is to provide the Minecraft community with a powerful, well-designed and thoughtful solution to extending and controlling their servers - making managing and creating servers easier and providing more flexibility. Learning from the mistakes made by other mods, Bukkit aims to be different and fill the void left by them: built from the ground up, we've focused on performance, ease-of-use, extreme customization and open communication between the Team and you, our users. The overall design of Bukkit has been inspired by other mods and our experience as Minecraft players just like yourselves, giving us a unique perspective and advantage going into the creation of the Bukkit Project</description>
